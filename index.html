<h1> About me >  </h1>
<p class="description" > I worked for five years in the dietary supplement industry developing vitamins and minerals. At some point I realized that I would be a much more efficient and useful employee if I could build tools that would make repetitive work more efficient. I've placed my career on pause to pursue this toolset full time. Currently. I'm a Masters of Software Development student at University of Utah.

<h2> What are my interests and goals? </h2>
<p> Currently, I am interested in data visualization tools and scientific computing. I hope that I will be able to assist in creating more efficient networks and workflows within many different fields of science. I have interests in people analytics within organizations and how to better measure individual productity and better categorize individual expertise. I'm deeply interested in transparent business structures and feel that software that can analyze people more precisely is a pre-requisite to making companies more transparent and effective. </p>
